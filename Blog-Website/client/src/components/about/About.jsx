            <strong>Albinism </strong>typically refers to oculocutaneous (ok-u-low-ku-TAY-nee-us) albinism
                        (OCA) â€” a group of inherited
                        disorders where there is little or no production of the pigment melanin. The type and amount of
                        melanin your body
                        produces determines the color of your skin, hair and eyes. Melanin also plays a role in the
                        development of optic nerves,
                        so people with albinism have vision problems.
            <p>Signs of albinism are usually apparent in a person's skin, hair and eye color, but sometimes
                        differences are slight.
                        People with albinism are also sensitive to the effects of the sun, so they're at increased risk
                        of developing skin
                        cancer. </p>

                    <p>Although there's no cure for albinism, people with the disorder can take steps to protect their
                        skin and eyes and
                        maximize their vision. </p>
